Common device configuration for the Unihertz Atom L and XL
=================================================
This common device tree is intended for the usage in a LineageOS or similar building environment.

If you are looking for a special device tree for the usage in a TWRP or similar environment head over to https://github.com/ADeadTrousers/twrp_device_Unihertz_Atom_LXL.

The Unihertz Atom L (codenamed simply _"Atom_L"_) and the Atom XL (codenamed simply _"Atom_XL"_) are two rugged small smartphones from Unihertz, released in July 2020. They are both almost identical except the Atom XL offers an integrated digital mobile radio (DMR).
